## Overview

The **Open-End Bin Packing Problem with Conflicts (OEBPPC)** extends the classical bin packing problem by introducing conflict constraints between items and allowing a subset of items to remain unpacked (open-ended structure). This repository includes:

- Modified Falkenauer instances adapted for OEBPPC
- GVNS solution results for the modified instances

These resources support the computational study in the aforementioned paper.

## Repository Contents

- ðŸ—‚ `Falkenauer_instances_modified_uXXX.zip`: Sets of modified instances with different item counts (e.g., `u120`, `u250`, `u500`, `u1000`, `u2000`)
- ðŸ“Š `GVNS Results.xlsx`: Best solutions (number of bins used) obtained using our GVNS algorithm
- ðŸ“„ `README.md`: This file

## Instance Format

Each `.zip` file contains multiple `.txt` instances. The naming follows this format:


Where:
- `XXX`: Instance size
- `YY`: Instance number
- `Z`: Seed or variation index

## GVNS Results

The `GVNS Results.xlsx` file includes:
- `instance`: Path and name of the instance
- `Z_GVNS`: Best objective value (i.e., number of bins used) obtained by the GVNS

## How to Use

1. Download and extract the relevant instance set.
2. Use your own bin packing solver to run the instances.
3. Compare your solutions with the `Z_GVNS` values in the Excel file.
